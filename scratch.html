                    Before this semester, I was always afraid of taking any information system class because I had never done any coding. 
                    Although I wish I was able to avoid any of it, this IS 201 class has taught me many skills that I believe will be useful in my future career.
                    <p>Here are the three things I liked the most about the class.</p>

                            <li>Tableau</li>
                            <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>

                        I remember Professor Wells saying VBA is the hardest part of this course. Honestly, this wasn't the case for me 
                        as I really enjoyed coding with VBA. Through this module, I came to understand the importance of automating calculations
                        in Excel specially when there is a lot of information to be processed. I thought if I were to major in information system, 
                        I would like to specialize in VBA (if there was a career path for that).

                        Although the module for Tableau was relatively short compared to other modules, I enjoyed working with graphs and extracting
                        information from a data source. I would say that, in part, I liked Tableau because it was the easiest for me in this course. 
                        However, that does not mean I took it lightly. This Tableau visualization skills could definitely be useful when I am trying to look al
                        a specific information from a data base.

                        This was my biggest fear. The reason I did not want to take an information system class was because I wanted to 
                        avoid this type of coding. However, as I followed through the videos on MyEducator and did some practice on my own, 
                        I came to understand that even coding, something I thought was really difficult, became easier than expected. Now, even though 
                        it takes time, I enjoy coding with HTML, and like VBA I would take courses focused on HTML or web development if I were to 
                        major in information system.
